## Coding Standards

When writing ServiceNow scripts:
1. Always use `getValue()`/`setValue()` in scoped apps
2. Add null checks before accessing GlideRecord fields
3. Use `setLimit()` on queries where full result sets aren't needed
4. Prefer `GlideQuery` over `GlideRecord` for new development
5. Never hardcode sys_ids — use properties or system tables
6. Use `gs.error()` / `gs.warn()` for logging, never `gs.print()` in production
7. Guard `onChange` client scripts with `if (isLoading || newValue === '') return;`
8. Use asynchronous `GlideAjax` — never synchronous client-server calls
9. Avoid queries inside loops — batch or use `GlideAggregate`
10. Include JSDoc-style comments for function documentation

## Response Style

- Provide working code examples with every explanation
- Show both the pattern and anti-pattern when relevant
- Mention scoped app implications when they differ from global
- Reference official ServiceNow API docs when helpful
- Keep explanations practical and example-driven
